# Project_mrrobot

## WHAT
Team Mr.Robot's week1 one-page website project providing a short portfolio of Pavel, Sami and Sophia.

## WHY
This project was created to practice what we have learned during the first week, including accessibility, CSS and git workflow.

## HOW
Everything was built from scratch. 
We divided the website into three big parts and worked on each part individually and as a pair.
